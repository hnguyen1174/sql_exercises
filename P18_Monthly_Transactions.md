## Tables and Schema

```
Table: Transactions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| country       | varchar |
| state         | enum    |
| amount        | int     |
| trans_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
```

## Question 1: Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m'), country
```
