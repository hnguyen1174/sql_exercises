## 1. SQL Schema


```sql
Create Table If Not Exists Insurance (pid int, tiv_2015 float, tiv_2016 float, lat float, lon float);
Truncate table Insurance;
insert into Insurance (pid, tiv_2015, tiv_2016, lat, lon) values ('1', '10', '5', '10', '10');
insert into Insurance (pid, tiv_2015, tiv_2016, lat, lon) values ('2', '20', '20', '20', '20');
insert into Insurance (pid, tiv_2015, tiv_2016, lat, lon) values ('3', '10', '30', '20', '20');
insert into Insurance (pid, tiv_2015, tiv_2016, lat, lon) values ('4', '10', '40', '40', '40');
```

```
Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Insurance table:
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
Output: 
+----------+
| tiv_2016 |
+----------+
| 45.00    |
+----------+
Explanation: 
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.
```

## 2. SQL Answer

```sql
WITH unique_lat_lon AS (
  SELECT
    lat, lon
  FROM Insurance
  GROUP BY lat, lon
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
),

same_2015_policy_amount AS (
  SELECT
    tiv_2015
  FROM Insurance
  GROUP BY tiv_2015
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)

SELECT
  ROUND(SUM(i.tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance i
JOIN unique_lat_lon u
  ON i.lat = u.lat
  AND i.lon = u.lon
JOIN same_2015_policy_amount p
  ON i.tiv_2015 = p.tiv_2015
;
```
