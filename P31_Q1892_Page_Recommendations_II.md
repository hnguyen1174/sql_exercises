You are implementing a page recommendation system for a social media website. Your system will recommended a page to user_id if the page is liked by at least one friend of user_id and is not liked by user_id.

Write an SQL query to find all the possible page recommendations for every user. Each recommendation should appear as a row in the result table with these columns:

user_id: The ID of the user that your system is making the recommendation to.
page_id: The ID of the page that will be recommended to user_id.
friends_likes: The number of the friends of user_id that like page_id.
Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
