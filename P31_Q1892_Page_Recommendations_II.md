```
Table: Friendship

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.

Table: Likes

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| page_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(user_id, page_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id likes page_id.
```

You are implementing a page recommendation system for a social media website. Your system will recommended a page to user_id if the page is liked by at least one friend of user_id and is not liked by user_id.

Write an SQL query to find all the possible page recommendations for every user. Each recommendation should appear as a row in the result table with these columns:

user_id: The ID of the user that your system is making the recommendation to.
page_id: The ID of the page that will be recommended to user_id.
friends_likes: The number of the friends of user_id that like page_id.
Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Input: 
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |

```sql
CREATE TABLE Friendship (
  user1_id INT,
  user2_id INT
);

INSERT INTO Friendship VALUES 
(1, 2),
(1, 3),
(1, 4),
(2, 3),
(2, 4),
(2, 5),
(6, 1);


CREATE TABLE Likes (
  user_id INT,
  page_id INT
);

INSERT INTO Likes VALUES 
(1, 88),
(2, 23),
(3, 24),
(4, 56),
(5, 11),
(6, 33),
(2, 77),
(3, 77),
(6, 88);
```

## Solution 1

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
SELECT * FROM 
(
SELECT * FROM Friendship
UNION 
(
  SELECT 
  user2_id AS user1_id,
  user1_id AS user2_id
  FROM Friendship
) 
) f
LEFT JOIN Likes l
ON f.user2_id = l.user_id
)


SELECT * FROM (
SELECT 
  user1_id AS user_id, 
  page_id,
  COUNT(user2_id) AS friends_likes
FROM CTE 
GROUP BY user1_id, page_id
ORDER BY user1_id, page_id DESC
) TMP
WHERE (user_id, page_id) NOT IN (
  SELECT user_id, page_id
  FROM Likes
)
ORDER BY user_id ASC, page_id DESC
```
